History
and
The
college
was
built
as
an
Independent
college
in
the
architects
being
Irwin
and
The
site
was
in
the
new
suburb
whose
development
had
been
begun
about
years
earlier
by
Samuel
its
name
later
became
Whalley
The
aim
of
the
Lancashire
Independent
College
was
a
project
of
the
Lancashire
Congregational
Union
to
provide
higher
education
for
who
were
excluded
from
the
Universities
of
Oxford
and
Cambridge
until
This
included
a
new
college
building
and

The
three
founders
were
Hadfield
Hadfield
Raffles
and
Roby
of
the
Grosvenor
Street
Chapel
London
Road
The
Blackburn
Academy
arose
from
courses
of
lessons
given
to
prospective
Congregational
ministers
by
William
Roby
who
was
supported
by
the
Manchester
merchant
Robert
When

principal
Fletcher

Fletcher
left
for
London
the
academy
became
the
Lancashire
Independent
College
and
moved
to
The
college
became
known
much
later
as
the
Northern
Congregational
The
similarity
of
design
to
an
college
is
therefore
easily
The
marshy
nature
of
the
area
then
called
Moss
meant
that
feet
of
peat
had
to
be
dug
away
before
safe
construction
could
Pevsner
commended
the
very
impressive
Gothic
The
wings
culminate
in
a
tower
with
a
Revival
The
entrance
and
assembly
halls
were
by
Waterhouse
in
and
considered
them
but
the
rooms
along
the
nobile
are
very
charming
their
Gothic
fireplaces
ceilings
and
doorcases
nicely
During
War
War
II
it
was
used
to
house
refugee
academics
mainly
from
The
later
name
of
the
college
was
the
Northern
Congregational
College
who
used
the
premises
until
when
they
joined
the
Northern
Baptist
College
in
Luther
King
House
Brighton
The
building
became
the
national
college
of
the
in
the
late
century
and

many
The
GMB
sold
the
college
in
as
it
was
considered
too
expensive

After
a
period
of
uncertainty
the
building
was
purchased
